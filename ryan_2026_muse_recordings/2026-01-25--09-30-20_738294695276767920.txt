Ended up doing 45 minutes of somewhat sleepier practier. I was tired and did the practice laying down, so there was less overall wakefulness. With that being said, I still did metta and then a body scan to start. In order to avoid too much craving or volitional activity, I am just making one attempt to grab the 1st jhana handle per sit. I did so after the body scan.

It didn't fully click at first but did transition into the real thing after a little while. I did make it up into a sort of borderline J3/J4 which had full body awareness but still had the weird, wtf feel that J3 can have, and I think I started to dip in and out of sleep afterwards.
