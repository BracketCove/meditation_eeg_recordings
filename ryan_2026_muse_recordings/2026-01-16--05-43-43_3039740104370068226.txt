Morning practice. Laid down on my bed this time around due to psoas issues. Nice, relaxing sit with a lot of noting. Started with metta for a few minutes, did a body scan, then noting. Towards the end of the sit, there was definitely some brief lapses into light sleep. I do not think they were long lived, and I did manage to note them pretty well.
