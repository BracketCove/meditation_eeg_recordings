Morning practice. Metta, body scan, then noting. First half or so had a fair amount of thought proliferation. This was followed by a very peaceful period without any noting. Then noting began again until equanimity was reached. This was noticed by a kind of spacious quality, and neutral but pleasant general feeling. Not sure but there was a possible cessation or some such event around 38 minutes or so. I recall being in equanimity while noting, then a brief drifting period, then my head bobbed forward slightly, with a noticeable exhale when things came back online.

NOTE: The spike around 39 minutes was me opening my eyes just after the event.
