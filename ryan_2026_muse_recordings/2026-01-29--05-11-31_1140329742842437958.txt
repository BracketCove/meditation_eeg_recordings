45 minute, few minutes of metta, then a body scan, then attempting to induce first jhana. Jhanic factors were pretty light during the first half of the sit; felt very soft jhana. From roughly the second half onwards, did noticing of a pretty open space. Hard to pinpoint but there were some times when I opened my eyes and blinked a bit in that second have. Towards the end, the body felt very expansive and there was lots of noticing all different sense doors; not all at once.
