Morning session, 45 minutes. Started with metta for a few minutes, then a body scan, then noting. Classic progression from 1st to 4th jhana marked by sizes of spotlight attention and transition of awareness to the foreground. This transition took around 3 to 5 minutes. Afterwards, for the rest of the sit, things were very expansive, with periods of minutes which were deeply tranquil. Unclear if this was a very hard 4th jhana or perhaps one of the formless jhanas. Awareness was much more about the general space and not localized to the body. There were periods where discursive thought would cease completely, which is not a common thing for this mind.
