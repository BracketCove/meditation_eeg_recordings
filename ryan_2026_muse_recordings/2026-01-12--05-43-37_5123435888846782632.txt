Morning practice. Started with met then general noting. Noting subsided perhaps half way through. It was a mixture of fairly calm and tranquil states punctuated by some stronger trains of thought popping up. Mindfulness was clear so this was not seen as a big issue; just the mind being a bit busier. Perhaps around 25 or 30 minutes, there was a sort of near-miss type event where the visual field collided with the sense of the observer. It did not have any kind of after glow or shut off but may have been in the ballpark of cessation territory.
