~38 minutes. Meditation got cut short today by the worldly winds. Started with metta but the mind had no inclination towards sticking to a particular place at first, so I started just noting. That also ended up with distractions. After a few minutes of that, I did a bit more metta and managed a body scan which grounded things a bit more.

So, for something like 6 months, even during my retreat, I essentially operated from a place of very little interference, particularly with samatha jhana. I think this was very helpful in that it taught me how letting go and letting things settle is one of the best ways to actually experience samatha jhana for me. Anyways, today I did something that I had not tried to do for a very long time. Trigger the jhana via the intention stream in a mental state which was not what I would normally consider conduscive to that.

It went something like this:
- Intention stream prompts attention to the position it normally goes to in samatha J1, which is basically an inch or to in front of the forehead/third eye area.
- "Hold" it there with a sense of effort, until the sense of effort disappates and/or the size of attention grows to encompass the whole face
- Once at that point, stop any interference as the transition to J3 occurs naturally shortly there-after, and is marked by body awareness slowly coming online. Usually it begins by noticing that my hands are now within awareness yet my face is still within attention (spotlight). Then gradually more and more body awareness comes online, though it does not feel filled in.
- The next step lately has been pretty consistent. There's sort of a feeling of everything physical dropping down a bit. My posture will relax down if sitting, if I have a smile my face will relax and go neutral, and the thought stream noticeably slows and quiets down. The only thing that doesn't drop is awareness, which paradoxically becomes clearer and more expansive as the other things happen. Also, for whatever reason, ever since retreat, I start a bit of diaphramatic breathing involuntarily.
