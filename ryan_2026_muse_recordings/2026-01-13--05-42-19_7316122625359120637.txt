Morning session, starting with meter, quick body scan, then general noting. The predominant characteristic of this sit was sort of sitting on the border between falling asleep and maintaining mindfulness. My head posture somewhat collapsed, and there were some brief periods of drifting into a sort of sleep state. Overall still maintained mindfulness. Likely due to this sleep-like state, the session went by quite quickly.
