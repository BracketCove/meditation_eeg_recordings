Morning sit, 45m. Very brief metta and body scan. After that, pretty intensive and fast paced noting for approximately 15 or so minutes. For the last 20 or so minutes, settled into a very spacious, peaceful state, with quite high clarity. There was also a natural viewing of everything as nonself without any prompting from the attention stream. Perhaps around 35 or 40 minutes, this view of nonself caused a drop into a very deep and blissful state. Sort of a natural letting go in seeing that all things, including the movements of the mind and external sounds, are ownerless. Overall quite a spacious and peaceful sit; even amongst periods with proliferation of thought.
