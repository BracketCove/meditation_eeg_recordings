Morning session, 45m. Started with Metta for a few minutes, then a body scan, then noting. Quite quickly after the body scan, a natural progression through the samatha Jhanas occurred. This was noted by attention fixated, then growing, then flipping over into full body awareness, awareness of a broad conscious space, then mostly dissolved sense of the body and any spacial boundaries. Curiously, in the last 5 minutes or so, the space contracted back down to the body awareness, perhaps indicating a return to 3rd samatha jhana, or a different vipassana jhana. Overall, the majority of the sit was spacious, relaxed, and tranquil.
